# Intelligens

A collection of artificial intelligence algorithms.

## About the name

The project's name isn't a typo. "Intelligens" means "intelligence" in Swedish.

I'm not a Swede nor I have anything to do with them, I just thought it would make for a cool name.

## About the structure

* `Intelligens.Optimization`: Algorithms related to optimization problems.
* `Intelligens.Tests`: Unit tests for all algorithms.
* `Intelligens.Extras`: Helpers and things of the sort.

## About the present

The following algorithms are already implemented and tested:

* Genetic algorithm

## About the future

The following algorithms will be implement in the near future:

* Simplex method
* Least squares
* Multinomial naive bayes network
* Gaussian naive bayes network
